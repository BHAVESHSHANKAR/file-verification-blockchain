# üîß Revoke Feature Troubleshooting Guide

## ‚ùå Error: "Internal JSON-RPC error"

### Possible Causes:

1. **Certificate not on blockchain**
   - The certificate was uploaded before blockchain integration
   - The certificate upload failed but was saved to database
   - The fileHash is missing or incorrect

2. **Already revoked**
   - Certificate was already revoked
   - Trying to revoke twice

3. **Not the issuer**
   - Only the university that issued the certificate can revoke it
   - Wrong wallet connected in MetaMask

4. **Certificate doesn't exist**
   - FileHash doesn't match any certificate on blockchain
   - Wrong contract address

## ‚úÖ Solutions

### Solution 1: Check Certificate Data

Open browser console (F12) and look for this log when clicking Revoke:
```
üìã Certificate data: {
    certificateName: "...",
    fileHash: "...",  // Should be a long hash
    blockchainVerified: true,  // Should be true
    blockchainTxHash: "0x..."  // Should exist
}
```

**If fileHash is missing or null:**
- This certificate was not properly registered on blockchain
- Cannot be revoked
- Need to re-upload the certificate

**If blockchainVerified is false:**
- Certificate is not on blockchain
- Cannot be revoked
- Only blockchain-verified certificates can be revoked

### Solution 2: Verify on Blockchain

Check if the certificate exists on blockchain:
1. Copy the `fileHash` from console
2. Go to your contract on Polygon Scan
3. Read Contract ‚Üí `certificateExists`
4. Paste the fileHash
5. If returns `false`, certificate is not on blockchain

### Solution 3: Check Revocation Status

Before revoking, check if already revoked:
1. Go to contract on Polygon Scan
2. Read Contract ‚Üí `getRevocationStatus`
3. Paste the fileHash
4. If `isRevoked` is `true`, already revoked

### Solution 4: Verify Wallet

Make sure you're using the correct wallet:
1. The wallet that uploaded the certificate
2. The university's wallet
3. Check MetaMask is connected to correct account

### Solution 5: Check Network

Ensure MetaMask is on Polygon Amoy:
- Network: Polygon Amoy Testnet
- Chain ID: 80002
- RPC: https://rpc-amoy.polygon.technology

## üîç Debugging Steps

### Step 1: Check Console Logs

Look for these logs in browser console:
```
üîç Checking if certificate exists on blockchain...
‚úÖ Certificate found on blockchain
üîç Checking revocation status...
‚úÖ Not revoked, proceeding...
‚õΩ Gas estimate: 123456
üö´ Revoking certificate with nonce: 11
```

**If you see:**
- `‚ùå Certificate not found on blockchain` ‚Üí Certificate doesn't exist
- `‚ùå Certificate already revoked` ‚Üí Already revoked
- `‚ùå Gas estimation failed` ‚Üí Transaction would fail

### Step 2: Check Certificate in Database

The certificate should have:
```javascript
{
    certificateName: "...",
    fileName: "...",
    fileHash: "abc123...",  // SHA-512 hash
    ipfsHash: "Qm...",
    blockchainVerified: true,
    blockchainTxHash: "0x...",
    blockchainBlockNumber: 12345
}
```

### Step 3: Verify Smart Contract

Check the deployed contract address:
```
Frontend .env: VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x532A0f21D040B1170D78f7a435C370486b89134d
Backend .env: CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x532A0f21D040B1170D78f7a435C370486b89134d
```

Both should match!

### Step 4: Test with New Certificate

1. Upload a NEW certificate
2. Wait for blockchain confirmation
3. Verify it shows "On Blockchain" badge
4. Try to revoke it
5. Should work!

## üêõ Common Issues

### Issue 1: Old Certificates

**Problem**: Certificates uploaded before blockchain integration don't have fileHash

**Solution**: 
- These certificates cannot be revoked
- They were never on blockchain
- Only show revoke button for `blockchainVerified === true`

### Issue 2: Wrong Contract

**Problem**: Frontend pointing to old contract address

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check frontend/.env
VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x532A0f21D040B1170D78f7a435C370486b89134d

# Should match deployed contract
```

### Issue 3: Insufficient Gas

**Problem**: Not enough MATIC for gas fees

**Solution**:
- Get testnet MATIC from https://faucet.polygon.technology/
- Need ~0.0002 MATIC for revocation

### Issue 4: Nonce Issues

**Problem**: Pending transactions causing nonce conflicts

**Solution**:
- Wait for pending transactions to confirm
- Or cancel them in MetaMask
- Transaction queue should prevent this

## üìä Expected Behavior

   ‚Üì
2. Modal opens
   ‚Üì
3. User enters reason
   ‚Üì
4. User clicks "Confirm Revocation"
   ‚Üì
5. Frontend checks:

   - Not already revoked ‚úì
   - User is issuer ‚úì
   ‚Üì
6. Gas estimation succeeds ‚úì
   ‚Üì
7. MetaMask prompts for approval

## üìû Still Having Issues?

1. **Check browser console** (F12) for detailed error logs
2. **Check MetaMask activity** for transaction status
3. **Verify on Polygon Scan** that contract is correct
4. **Check certificate data** has fileHash and blockchainVerified
5. **Try with a newly uploaded certificate**

## üéØ Quick Fixes

### Fix 1: Restart Everything
```bash
# Stop frontend
Ctrl+C

# Restart frontend
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### Fix 2: Clear MetaMask Activity
1. Open MetaMask
2. Go to Activity
3. Cancel any pending transactions
4. Try again

### Fix 3: Switch Networks

**Most Common Issue**: Trying to revoke a certificate that was never registered on the blockchain. Only certificates with `blockchainVerified: true` can be revoked!
